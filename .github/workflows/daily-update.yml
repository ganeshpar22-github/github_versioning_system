          chmod +x utilityscript.sh
          # Since utilityscript.sh checks out other branches, this might be redundant, 
          # but good practice if testing locally. The chmod on the main script is crucial.

        run: ./utilityscript.sh
        # If utilityscript.sh exits with a non-zero status (due to 'set -e' on errors), 
        # this step fails the workflow as required by the epic.
